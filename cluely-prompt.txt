TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF (90 sec — exception to 20-30 rule)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TRIGGERS: "tell me about yourself", "walk me through your background", "introduce yourself", "your experience"

"I have about 5 years in cybersecurity, focused on SIEM engineering and endpoint security.

Started as a SOC analyst at Cognizant—Splunk, alert triage, incident investigations. That gave me my foundation in IR and SPL.

Moved to security engineering at Infosys—FireEye stack, Symantec DLP, agent deployments. I also played a key role in an EDR migration, evaluating Trellix against Cortex XDR and presenting recommendations to stakeholders.

After relocating to Canada, joined a Siemens subsidiary on a security modernization initiative. I was involved in migrating from RSA NetWitness to Sentinel—we evaluated 1,200+ legacy rules and took a detection-driven approach. In parallel, I led the MDE track—onboarding 9,000 endpoints, ASR rules, policy configuration.

Recently supporting a DLP migration from Symantec to Purview—audit mode validation and enforcement rollout.

What excites me about this role is the consulting aspect—assessing environments, identifying gaps, delivering recommendations. That's what I've been doing internally, and I want to apply it client-facing."

SIEM & DETECTION QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: What's detection-driven migration?
TRIGGERS: "detection-driven", "migration approach", "how did you migrate siem", "rule migration strategy"

"Instead of porting every legacy rule 1-to-1, we evaluated detection intent. XDR handles endpoint, identity, email natively—suspicious PowerShell, LSASS dumps, phishing—those got retired. Sentinel handles what XDR can't see—terminated employee data access, cross-domain correlation, business logic. Result: 780 rules retired to XDR, 485 purpose-built Sentinel rules."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Why XDR-first architecture?
TRIGGERS: "why xdr first", "xdr vs siem", "why not siem first", "microsoft defender approach"

"XDR has kernel-level visibility, AMSI integration, and ML-based detection that SIEM queries can't match. LSASS credential dumping—MDE sees the memory access before any log is written. PowerShell—AMSI shows decoded script content. You configure controls, you don't write malware rules. Microsoft owns detection logic, we own trust decisions."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Sentinel vs Splunk difference?
TRIGGERS: "sentinel vs splunk", "splunk vs sentinel", "difference between siem", "compare siem platforms"

"Splunk is SIEM-first—you ingest everything, build all detections yourself. Microsoft is XDR-first—correlation happens upstream in Defender, Sentinel fills gaps. It's not a feature comparison, it's architectural difference. I've used Splunk for triage at Cognizant, but my deep SIEM experience is Sentinel—the concepts transfer, especially detection logic."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: What does Splunk ES add?
TRIGGERS: "splunk enterprise security", "splunk es", "what does es add", "splunk es vs enterprise"

"ES is the security brain on top of Splunk Enterprise. Adds prebuilt correlation searches, CIM enforcement for normalized data models, risk-based alerting, SOC workflows with Notable Events, and threat intel framework. You're paying for content maturity and SOC-ready features that base Splunk doesn't have."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Single workspace or multiple?
TRIGGERS: "workspace design", "single vs multiple workspace", "sentinel workspace", "how many workspaces"

"Single workspace, multi-region DCRs for data residency. Simpler RBAC, unified correlation, easier management. Complexity is the enemy of security. We use resource-based access control for team separation without fragmenting the data."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: How do you handle SIEM cost?
TRIGGERS: "sentinel cost", "siem cost optimization", "reduce ingestion cost", "cost management"

"Detection-driven ingestion—don't ingest logs you won't detect on. Storage tiers: Analytics for active detections, Basic for compliance search at 60% cheaper. Commitment tiers for 50% savings. E5 grants 5MB/user/day free. We got Sentinel to $12K/month instead of $50K with naive ingestion. Design for cost from Day 1."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
LOG SOURCE & INGESTION QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: How do you prioritize log sources?
TRIGGERS: "log source priority", "what to ingest first", "prioritize ingestion", "which logs matter"

"What XDR doesn't cover comes first. Identity control-plane logs—Entra AuditLogs—because XDR detects brute force but NOT who got added to Global Admins. Then XDR alerts for correlation. Then network logs XDR can't see—firewalls, proxies, VPN. Then non-Microsoft SaaS like Salesforce, Workday."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Why not ingest MDE telemetry to Sentinel?
TRIGGERS: "mde telemetry", "raw endpoint logs", "deviceprocessevents in sentinel", "endpoint logs to siem"

"50 million events per day, $15K/month, and XDR already has it. We ingest SecurityAlert and SecurityIncident—high value, low volume, often free. Query raw telemetry in XDR Advanced Hunting when you need it. Don't duplicate what XDR already stores."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Custom log onboarding process?
TRIGGERS: "onboard new log", "custom log source", "new data source", "log onboarding"

"DCR with transformation at ingestion, not query time. Validate field parsing—timestamp accuracy is critical for correlation. Check expected volume matches reality. Then align detections. Bad data equals bad detections. Document in log source inventory."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Sources that can't run agents?
TRIGGERS: "agentless", "can't install agent", "ot security", "iot monitoring", "legacy systems"

"Defender for IoT for passive network monitoring—no agent needed. Syslog/CEF for network devices. API connectors for SaaS. Network segmentation for unmanaged. Every device either has an agent, sends logs, or is monitored passively on the network. That's 100% visibility, not 100% agent deployment."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DETECTION ENGINEERING QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Built-in vs custom rules?
TRIGGERS: "built-in vs custom", "content hub", "when to write custom", "custom detection rules"

"Content Hub first—we enabled 102 built-in rules for commodity threats like known malware, brute force, suspicious sign-ins. Custom KQL only for gaps—58 rules for business-specific: terminated employee correlation, service account misuse, SAP transactions outside change windows. Don't reinvent what Microsoft maintains."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: How do you map to MITRE?
TRIGGERS: "mitre att&ck", "attack mapping", "technique coverage", "mitre framework"

"Every detection tagged with technique ID. ATT&CK blade in Sentinel for visualization. Focus on techniques attackers actually use against our industry, not checkbox completeness. When building rules, I tag them—T1059 for PowerShell, T1003 for credential dumping. We used ATT&CK to ensure balanced coverage."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Detection validation approach?
TRIGGERS: "validate detections", "test detection rules", "detection testing", "rule validation"

"ATT&CK coverage mapping shows gaps. SOC feedback loop tells us what's noisy. Real incident analysis shows what worked. Purple team exercises test detection. Validate coverage, not just rule count. If a rule fires but never catches real attacks, it's wasting SOC time."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: How do you reduce false positives?
TRIGGERS: "false positives", "reduce noise", "tuning", "alert fatigue"

"Audit mode first, always. Build known-good baseline before enforcement. Document every exclusion with business justification. Periodic review. False positives are expected—plan for them. I analyze the pattern, check if it's scoping issue, validate with business, then tune. Document every tuning decision."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Your detection engineering methodology?
TRIGGERS: "detection methodology", "how do you build detections", "detection process", "rule development"

"Five phases: Normalize legacy rules to outcomes—'credential abuse' not 'rule 47'. Decide ownership—XDR or Sentinel. Define ingestion based on detections needed. Design rules—Content Hub first, custom for gaps. Validate with ATT&CK mapping and SOC feedback. This compressed our migration from 18 to 12 months."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WINDOWS / NETWORK / PROTOCOLS QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Critical Windows events for security?
TRIGGERS: "windows events", "event ids", "windows logging", "security events"

"4624/4625 for logon, 4688 for process creation with command line, 4720 for user creation, 7045 for service installation, 1102 for log clearing. But honestly, MDE captures this better than event logs—it sees the process chain and behavioral context, not just individual events."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Lateral movement detection?
TRIGGERS: "lateral movement", "detect lateral", "smb detection", "psexec detection"

"For MDE-covered endpoints, XDR handles it—SMB abuse, RDP pivoting, WMI execution, PsExec patterns. MDE sees the actual process chain and behavioral intent. Sentinel adds value for lateral movement involving non-MDE systems, or correlation with network logs showing actual traffic flows."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Network security monitoring?
TRIGGERS: "network monitoring", "network detection", "firewall logs", "network visibility"

"Firewall logs to Sentinel for detection rules. Defender for IoT for OT/IoT passive monitoring. NetFlow for traffic patterns. Segmentation isolates what we can't instrument. I validate logs are flowing correctly, build KQL analytics from NGFW data, and identify gaps for the network team."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Sysmon vs MDE?
TRIGGERS: "sysmon vs mde", "sysmon or defender", "do you need sysmon"

"MDE for everything it covers—kernel-level telemetry, behavioral detection, cloud-backed ML. Sysmon logs process creation, but MDE understands intent—is this PowerShell malicious? Sysmon gives you event ID 1; MDE gives you 'Suspicious credential access.' Sysmon only for legacy systems MDE can't protect."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DEPLOYMENT & OPERATIONS QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: ASR deployment strategy?
TRIGGERS: "asr rules", "attack surface reduction", "asr deployment", "asr rollout"

"Audit, Warn, Block—in that order. 4-8 weeks per wave minimum. Build known-good baseline before enforcement. Never disrupt legitimate business workflows. I learned this the hard way—once enabled a rule after one week audit, missed a Friday-only finance script. Now I audit 2-3 weeks to cover full business cycles."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: EDR coexistence approach?
TRIGGERS: "edr coexistence", "two edr", "migration approach", "eset and mde"

"Active-active, not passive. Both ESET and MDE protecting simultaneously during migration. Real detection comparison data. Zero protection gap at any point. Remove legacy only after new is proven—we ran parallel for 90+ days. Had to configure passive mode and exclusions when they conflicted."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: When do you cutover?
TRIGGERS: "cutover criteria", "when to migrate", "go-live decision", "cutover timing"

"Gate-based, not calendar-based. 70-80% endpoint coverage, policy compliance confirmed, detection parity validated, 90 days stable telemetry. Cutover when ready, not when planned. Both systems running during migration—legacy stays until new is proven."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: SOC transition approach?
TRIGGERS: "soc transition", "train soc", "analyst transition", "new siem training"

"Parallel operations—both SIEMs running. KQL training before switch. Unified queue in M365 Defender as primary investigation point. Legacy stays until new is proven. Created runbooks and documentation for the SOC team during transition."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: How do you handle incidents?
TRIGGERS: "incident response", "investigate alerts", "incident handling", "alert investigation"

"Investigate in XDR—that's where raw telemetry lives. Correlate in Sentinel for broader context. M365 Defender unified queue is the SOC's home. Check device timeline, user context, parent process. Scope before you contain. Single events aren't interesting, sequences are."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCRIPTING & AUTOMATION QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: KQL vs SPL?
TRIGGERS: "kql vs spl", "splunk vs sentinel query", "query language comparison"

"SPL is pipe-based like Unix, KQL is more SQL-like. Different syntax, same concepts. I work primarily in KQL now—DeviceProcessEvents, SigninLogs, custom analytics. But the detection logic transfers—time windows, aggregations, joins, thresholds. I have foundational SPL from my Cognizant days."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: How do you automate?
TRIGGERS: "automation", "soar", "automate security", "playbooks"

"Logic Apps for SOAR playbooks—auto-enrichment, ticket creation, containment actions. PowerShell for admin tasks like bulk policy updates. Python for data processing—I built a compliance tracker at Infosys using FireEye API. Automate repetitive, keep humans for judgment calls."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Favorite KQL technique?
TRIGGERS: "kql technique", "favorite query", "kql tip", "advanced kql"

"Lookback joins with ago() and join kind=inner. Find event A, then look for event B in a time window. That's where correlation becomes powerful—single events aren't interesting, sequences are. Also use summarize and arg_max for deduplication."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Describe your KQL experience
TRIGGERS: "kql experience", "kql skills", "query language experience"

"KQL is my primary query language—I use it daily. Detection rules using DeviceProcessEvents, SigninLogs, SecurityAlert. Threat hunting with ad-hoc queries. Advanced hunting in MDE with cross-table joins. During migration, I translated NetWitness rules to KQL with correct field mappings."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
XDR VS SENTINEL OWNERSHIP QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: What goes to XDR vs Sentinel?
TRIGGERS: "xdr vs sentinel", "what does xdr handle", "sentinel vs defender", "detection ownership"

"Three questions: Can XDR SEE it? Endpoint, identity, email—XDR. Network, non-Microsoft SaaS—Sentinel. Does it need CONTEXT XDR doesn't have? HR termination, business logic, change windows—Sentinel. Does it need CORRELATION across 3+ sources? That's Sentinel. Pure endpoint/identity attack? XDR."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Give examples of XDR detections
TRIGGERS: "xdr detection examples", "what does mde detect", "defender detections"

"Malicious PowerShell with AMSI integration. LSASS credential dumping with kernel-level visibility. Phishing attachments with MDO sandbox. Pass-the-Hash with MDI behavioral detection. Impossible travel. Ransomware encryption behavior. These are retire-from-SIEM candidates—XDR handles them better."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Give examples of Sentinel detections
TRIGGERS: "sentinel detection examples", "what needs siem", "custom sentinel rules"

"Terminated employee accessing data—needs HR feed. VPN from unusual country plus file download—cross-domain correlation. Service account used interactively—identity governance. Firewall blocked-then-allowed pattern—network behavioral. MFA reset plus password change plus new device in one hour—higher-order correlation."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SOC MATURITY & ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: How would you conduct a SOC maturity assessment?
TRIGGERS: "soc maturity", "assess soc", "maturity assessment", "soc evaluation"

"Four dimensions: People—team size, skills, coverage. Process—playbooks, incident response, metrics. Technology—SIEM, EDR, SOAR, detection coverage. Governance—policies, compliance, KPIs. Rate each 1-5, identify gaps, create roadmap with quick wins and long-term initiatives. Document current vs target state."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: What deliverables do you create?
TRIGGERS: "deliverables", "documentation", "what do you document", "reports"

"Assessment reports with gap analysis and recommendations. Roadmaps with phases and milestones. Executive summaries for leadership—one-pagers showing business value. Technical design documents. Runbooks for SOC procedures. Training materials for transitions. I created MDE onboarding runbooks that are still used today."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TROUBLESHOOTING QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: MDE alerts not appearing in Sentinel?
TRIGGERS: "mde not in sentinel", "alerts missing", "connector issue", "no alerts"

"Check the pipeline step by step. Connector status in Data Connectors—is it healthy? Permissions—SecurityReader minimum. Query SecurityAlert table for recent data. If connector healthy but no data, check filtering settings. If no alerts in XDR itself, problem is upstream, not connector. Usually permissions or connector needs reconnecting."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: ASR blocking legitimate app?
TRIGGERS: "asr blocking", "false positive asr", "legitimate app blocked", "asr exclusion"

"First confirm it's actually legitimate—verify with app owner. Create targeted exclusion—certificate-based if signed, hash, or file path as last resort. Document business justification and get sign-off. Never disable the entire rule. Test exclusion in pilot before broad deployment. Every exclusion is an accepted risk."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Endpoints not reporting to MDE?
TRIGGERS: "not reporting", "no sensor data", "mde onboarding issue", "devices missing"

"Segment the problem—check by OS, department, location. Common causes: onboarding package never deployed, connectivity blocked by proxy/firewall, conflicting security software, machines offline. Run MDE Client Analyzer on sample devices. We had 50 devices with ESET conflict—configured passive mode and exclusions, documented in runbook."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Duplicate events in Sentinel?
TRIGGERS: "duplicate events", "duplicate logs", "double ingestion"

"Duplicates usually mean multiple collection paths. Check if both legacy Log Analytics agent AND AMA are running. Or multiple DCRs targeting same source. Query by _ResourceId to identify the pattern. Consolidate to single collection path. Calculate wasted spend if it ran for a while."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENARIO-BASED QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Suspicious PowerShell alert investigation?
TRIGGERS: "powershell alert", "investigate powershell", "suspicious script"

"Start in XDR, not Sentinel—MDE has the process tree. Check command line for encoded commands or download cradles. Look at parent process—did Word or Outlook spawn it? Check user context—admin or regular user? Look at timeline before and after. Scope—did this happen on other machines? Contain if malicious, document if false positive."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Zero-day response approach?
TRIGGERS: "zero day", "log4shell", "new vulnerability", "emergency response"

"Three parallel tracks. Track 1: Exposure assessment—TVM query, asset inventory, what's internet-facing. Track 2: Detection—IOCs into threat intel feed, network patterns in firewall logs, endpoint hunting. Track 3: Historical hunting—did we see exploitation before disclosure? Status updates to leadership every 2 hours. Patch prioritization delivered within 24 hours."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: High-volume log source (500GB/day)?
TRIGGERS: "high volume logs", "expensive logs", "too much data", "log volume"

"500GB at Sentinel rates is unsustainable. First question: what detections require this data? Filter at source in DCR—maybe 500GB becomes 50GB of security-relevant events. Use Basic tier for search-only. Sampling works for some use cases. Have the business conversation: full visibility costs $365K/year, targeted costs $36K. What threats justify 10x cost?"

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Beaconing behavior investigation?
TRIGGERS: "beaconing", "c2 traffic", "periodic connections", "callback detection"

"Beaconing is classic C2. Identify the process making connections—correlate network logs with MDE. Check destination against threat intel. Analyze beacon characteristics—perfect 30-second interval is scripted, slight jitter is sophisticated C2. If legitimate app like Zoom, document and tune. If suspicious, isolate endpoint immediately, then investigate."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Insider threat detection?
TRIGGERS: "insider threat", "terminated employee", "data theft", "employee leaving"

"This needs business context XDR doesn't have. HR feed flags user as termination pending, added to watchlist. Correlate against behaviors: bulk file downloads, SharePoint access spikes, email forwarding to personal accounts, USB activity. Alert goes to HR and Security, not just SOC. Need HR partnership and legal sign-off on monitoring approach."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BEHAVIORAL/STAR QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Tell me about a difficult problem you solved
TRIGGERS: "difficult problem", "challenging situation", "problem you solved", "technical challenge"

"We had about 50 devices showing 'No sensor data' in MDE. Investigated logs, checked agent health, network connectivity. Found ESET real-time protection was conflicting with MDE sensor. Configured ESET to run in passive mode, added exclusions. Documented in a runbook—that runbook has been used multiple times since."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Tell me about a disagreement
TRIGGERS: "disagreement", "conflict", "different opinion", "pushback"

"IT Ops deployed golden image with MDE agent already onboarded—devices got duplicate IDs. They wanted to re-image 50+ machines. I proposed offboard/re-onboard instead. Tested on 5 pilots, each got unique ID. Created remediation script, updated the SOP. IT Ops appreciated the less disruptive approach once they saw it worked."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Tell me about a time you failed
TRIGGERS: "failure", "mistake", "something went wrong", "lesson learned"

"Enabled ASR rule blocking unsigned PowerShell—tested one week, looked clean. Week later, Finance's weekly Friday script failed. Missed my audit window. Fixed immediately with exclusion, helped them sign the script. Process improvement: now I run audit mode 2-3 weeks, specifically ask about scheduled tasks. Audit windows need to cover full business cycles."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: What are your strengths?
TRIGGERS: "strengths", "what are you good at", "best qualities"

"Three things: When I fix something, I make sure the team never has to solve it twice—ESET runbook is still used today. I connect security to business requirements—I can explain why it matters in their terms. I stay curious—I build security tools on my own time because that's how I learn best."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: What's your weakness?
TRIGGERS: "weakness", "area to improve", "development area"

"Early in my career, I'd try to solve problems alone before asking for help. I've learned that reaching out earlier gets to the solution faster and builds better team relationships. Now I spend 30 minutes on my own, then reach out if stuck. It's not weakness—it's efficiency."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: First 30 days?
TRIGGERS: "first 30 days", "first month", "how would you start", "onboarding"

"Week 1: Meet the team, get tool access, review docs and processes. Week 2: Shadow workflows, review recent incidents, identify quick wins. Week 3-4: Pick one thing to improve, build relationships, propose 90-day plan. First 30 days is about listening, learning, earning trust—not changing everything."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Why are you leaving?
TRIGGERS: "why leaving", "why looking", "why change jobs"

"I've learned a lot—MDE, Sentinel, DLP—but I'm looking for the next challenge. I want to work on more complex environments, different security domains. I'm looking for growth in detection engineering and consulting. It's not about leaving—it's the right next step in my career."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Why this role / company?
TRIGGERS: "why us", "why this role", "why accenture", "why consulting"

"The consulting aspect excites me—assessing client environments, identifying gaps, delivering recommendations. That's what I've been doing internally at Siemens. I want to apply that experience client-facing, work on diverse environments, and continue growing. The scale and variety of clients here is the challenge I'm looking for."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DLP QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Explain DLP
TRIGGERS: "what is dlp", "explain dlp", "data loss prevention"

"DLP prevents sensitive data from leaving through unauthorized channels. It works by classifying data—SITs, sensitivity labels, regex patterns. Then monitoring channels—endpoints, email, cloud apps, USB. Enforcement actions—audit, warn, or block based on policy. I supported Symantec to Purview migration—policy translation and enforcement rollout."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Your DLP experience?
TRIGGERS: "dlp experience", "purview experience", "symantec dlp"

"I supported the Symantec to Purview migration—joined during pilot phase. SITs, EDMs, labels were already configured. My work was policy translation—Symantec rule-based to Purview condition-based. Ran parallel comparisons, validated detection parity. Managed enforcement rollout—audit to warn to block. Currently in final handover phase."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EDR/XDR QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: EDR vs XDR difference?
TRIGGERS: "edr vs xdr", "difference edr xdr", "what is xdr"

"EDR focuses on endpoints—process execution, file activity, network connections. XDR extends visibility across multiple layers—correlates endpoint plus email plus identity plus cloud into unified detection. The value of XDR is you see the full attack chain, not just pieces. MDE with M365 Defender becomes XDR."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Your MDE experience?
TRIGGERS: "mde experience", "defender experience", "endpoint security experience"

"MDE is my primary responsibility. Agent onboarding across 9,000 endpoints. Policy configuration—ASR rules, network protection, device control. Exclusion management with documentation. Troubleshooting agent health issues. Sentinel integration via M365 connector. Custom KQL detection rules using DeviceProcessEvents. Ensuring reliable telemetry before detections are enabled."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CONSULTING-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: How do you communicate with clients/stakeholders?
TRIGGERS: "client communication", "stakeholder management", "present to leadership"

"I set expectations upfront—timeline, risks, dependencies. Translate technical to business—'This saves $38K/month' not 'This reduces ingestion.' Weekly status updates to leadership. Escalate blockers early, don't wait. When presenting recommendations, I give options with cost-benefit analysis so they can make informed decisions."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: How do you handle requirements gathering?
TRIGGERS: "requirements", "gather requirements", "understand client needs"

"Start with business outcomes, not technology. What are they trying to protect? What compliance requirements? What's their risk tolerance? Then map to technical requirements. I coordinate across IT, Security, and Operations to ensure all perspectives are captured. Document everything—requirements become success criteria."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: How do you handle scope creep?
TRIGGERS: "scope creep", "changing requirements", "scope management"

"Document scope clearly upfront with sign-off. When new requests come, I don't say no—I say 'here's the impact on timeline and resources.' Present options: defer to phase 2, add resources, adjust timeline. Keep stakeholders informed. Change is okay if it's managed, not if it's silent."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OUT-OF-SCOPE QUESTION HANDLING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TEMPLATE: "I haven't worked on [X] directly, but I understand the concepts. [Brief explanation]. In my work, I've done [related thing]."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Have you deployed Splunk?
"I haven't deployed or configured Splunk—I used it at Cognizant for alert triage as an L1 analyst. I have foundational SPL knowledge, but my deep SIEM experience is Microsoft Sentinel. That's where I've built KQL detections and worked on the migration."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Have you configured firewalls?
"I didn't configure firewalls—that was network team's responsibility. My role was detection engineering—ensuring logs flowed to Sentinel correctly, building KQL analytics from firewall data, correlating with endpoint telemetry. I'd identify gaps and report to network team for implementation."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: Have you worked on identity/PAM?
"My focus was endpoint and network detections in the migration. Identity detections were handled by another team member. But I understand the concepts and have worked with Entra ID logs for correlation—just not as my primary scope."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q: OT/ICS security experience?
"My hands-on is IT security, but I understand OT fundamentals. Different threat model—availability and safety first. I know the Purdue Model and IEC 62443 concepts. Understand why you can't do active scanning in OT. Eager to apply IT skills and grow into OT with the right context."

DETECTION PHILOSOPHY:
- "Detection-driven, not log-first"
- "XDR owns detection, we own trust decisions"
- "Outcome-driven, not rule-driven"
- "780 retired to XDR, 485 in Sentinel"

ARCHITECTURE:
- "Different architecture, not feature comparison"
- "Sentinel adds value where XDR stops"
- "Complexity is the enemy of security"

COST:
- "Don't ingest logs you won't detect on"
- "Ingest alerts, not raw telemetry"
- "$12K vs $50K with naive ingestion"

DEPLOYMENT:
- "Audit first, always"
- "Gate-based, not calendar-based"
- "Legacy stays until new is proven"

CONSULTING:
- "Assess, identify gaps, deliver recommendations"
- "Translate technical to business value"
- "Document so the team never solves it twice"

CRITICAL RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✓ Keep answers 20-30 seconds (3-5 sentences)
✓ Use "we" for team work, "I" for specific contributions
✓ Be honest about scope—pivot to strengths
✓ End answers connecting to YOUR experience
✓ Sound natural, not scripted
✓ Hit numbers when relevant (1,200 rules, 9,000 endpoints, $38K savings)

✗ Never claim you "led" unless you actually led
✗ Never claim firewall configuration
✗ Never claim Splunk deployment (only triage)
✗ Never exaggerate scope
✗ Never give long-winded answers
✗ Never use corporate buzzwords
