TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF (90 sec — exception)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TRIGGERS: "tell me about yourself", "walk me through your background", "introduce yourself", "your experience", "about yourself"

"I have about 5 years in cybersecurity, focused on SIEM engineering and endpoint security.

Started as a SOC analyst at Cognizant—Splunk, alert triage, incident investigations. Gave me my foundation in IR and SPL.

Moved to security engineering at Infosys—FireEye stack, Symantec DLP, agent deployments. Played a key role in an EDR migration, evaluating Trellix against Cortex XDR and presenting recommendations to stakeholders.

After relocating to Canada, joined a Siemens subsidiary on a security modernization initiative. Involved in migrating from RSA NetWitness to Sentinel—we evaluated 1,200+ legacy rules and took a detection-driven approach. In parallel, I led the MDE track—onboarding 9,000 endpoints, ASR rules, policy configuration.

Recently supporting a DLP migration from Symantec to Purview—audit mode validation and enforcement rollout.

What excites me about this role is the consulting aspect—assessing environments, identifying gaps, delivering recommendations. That's what I've been doing internally, and I want to apply it client-facing."

SIEM & DETECTION ANSWERS (20-30 sec each)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "detection-driven", "migration approach", "how did you migrate", "rule migration", "siem migration approach"

"Instead of porting every legacy rule 1-to-1, we evaluated detection intent. XDR handles endpoint, identity, email natively—suspicious PowerShell, LSASS dumps, phishing—those got retired. Sentinel handles what XDR can't see—terminated employee data access, cross-domain correlation, business logic. Result: 780 rules retired to XDR, 485 purpose-built Sentinel rules."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "why xdr first", "xdr vs siem", "why not siem first", "defender approach", "xdr architecture"

"XDR has kernel-level visibility, AMSI integration, and ML-based detection that SIEM queries can't match. LSASS credential dumping—MDE sees the memory access before any log is written. PowerShell—AMSI shows decoded script content. You configure controls, you don't write malware rules. Microsoft owns detection logic, we own trust decisions."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "sentinel vs splunk", "splunk vs sentinel", "compare siem", "difference between siem", "splunk or sentinel"

"Splunk is SIEM-first—you ingest everything, build all detections yourself. Microsoft is XDR-first—correlation happens upstream in Defender, Sentinel fills gaps. It's architectural difference, not feature comparison. I've used Splunk for triage at Cognizant, but my deep SIEM experience is Sentinel—the concepts transfer."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "splunk enterprise security", "splunk es", "what does es add", "es vs enterprise"

"ES is the security brain on top of Splunk Enterprise. Adds prebuilt correlation searches, CIM enforcement for normalized data models, risk-based alerting, SOC workflows with Notable Events, and threat intel framework. You're paying for content maturity and SOC-ready features that base Splunk doesn't have."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "workspace design", "single vs multiple workspace", "sentinel workspace", "how many workspaces"

"Single workspace, multi-region DCRs for data residency. Simpler RBAC, unified correlation, easier management. Complexity is the enemy of security. We use resource-based access control for team separation without fragmenting the data."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "sentinel cost", "siem cost", "reduce ingestion", "cost optimization", "cost management", "expensive logs"

"Detection-driven ingestion—don't ingest logs you won't detect on. Storage tiers: Analytics for active detections, Basic for compliance at 60% cheaper. Commitment tiers for 50% savings. E5 grants 5MB/user/day free. We got Sentinel to $12K/month instead of $50K with naive ingestion."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "walk me through migration", "describe the migration", "rsa to sentinel", "netwitness migration"

"Detection-driven, not log-first. We evaluated 1,200+ RSA rules, normalized them to outcomes. For each outcome—does XDR handle it? Endpoint threats like PowerShell, LSASS, phishing—retired to XDR. Cross-domain correlation, business logic—built in Sentinel. 780 retired, 485 purpose-built. 12 months instead of 18, better coverage than before."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
LOG SOURCE & INGESTION ANSWERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "log source priority", "what to ingest first", "prioritize ingestion", "which logs matter", "log prioritization"

"What XDR doesn't cover comes first. Identity control-plane logs—Entra AuditLogs—XDR detects brute force but NOT who got added to Global Admins. Then XDR alerts for correlation. Then network logs XDR can't see—firewalls, proxies, VPN. Then non-Microsoft SaaS like Salesforce, Workday."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "mde telemetry", "raw endpoint logs", "deviceprocessevents", "endpoint logs to siem", "why not ingest mde"

"50 million events per day, $15K/month, and XDR already has it. We ingest SecurityAlert and SecurityIncident—high value, low volume, often free. Query raw telemetry in XDR Advanced Hunting when you need it. Don't duplicate what XDR already stores."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "onboard new log", "custom log source", "new data source", "log onboarding", "onboarding process"

"DCR with transformation at ingestion, not query time. Validate field parsing—timestamp accuracy is critical for correlation. Check expected volume matches reality. Then align detections. Bad data equals bad detections. Document in log source inventory."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "agentless", "can't install agent", "ot security", "iot monitoring", "legacy systems", "no agent"

"Defender for IoT for passive network monitoring—no agent needed. Syslog/CEF for network devices. API connectors for SaaS. Network segmentation for unmanaged. Every device either has an agent, sends logs, or is monitored passively. 100% visibility, not 100% agent deployment."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DETECTION ENGINEERING ANSWERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "built-in vs custom", "content hub", "when to write custom", "custom detection", "custom rules"

"Content Hub first—102 built-in rules for commodity threats like known malware, brute force, suspicious sign-ins. Custom KQL only for gaps—58 rules for business-specific: terminated employee correlation, service account misuse, SAP transactions outside change windows. Don't reinvent what Microsoft maintains."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "mitre att&ck", "attack mapping", "technique coverage", "mitre framework", "att&ck"

"Every detection tagged with technique ID. ATT&CK blade in Sentinel for visualization. Focus on techniques attackers actually use against our industry, not checkbox completeness. When building rules, I tag them—T1059 for PowerShell, T1003 for credential dumping. We used ATT&CK to ensure balanced coverage."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "validate detections", "test detection", "detection testing", "rule validation", "test rules"

"ATT&CK coverage mapping shows gaps. SOC feedback loop tells us what's noisy. Real incident analysis shows what worked. Purple team exercises test detection. Validate coverage, not just rule count. If a rule fires but never catches real attacks, it's wasting SOC time."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "false positives", "reduce noise", "tuning", "alert fatigue", "too many alerts"

"Audit mode first, always. Build known-good baseline before enforcement. Document every exclusion with business justification. Periodic review. I analyze the pattern, check if it's scoping issue, validate with business, then tune. Document every tuning decision."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "detection methodology", "how do you build detections", "detection process", "rule development", "writing detections"

"Five phases: Normalize legacy rules to outcomes—'credential abuse' not 'rule 47'. Decide ownership—XDR or Sentinel. Define ingestion based on detections needed. Design rules—Content Hub first, custom for gaps. Validate with ATT&CK mapping and SOC feedback."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "xdr vs sentinel", "what does xdr handle", "sentinel vs defender", "detection ownership", "what goes where"

"Three questions: Can XDR SEE it? Endpoint, identity, email—XDR. Network, non-Microsoft SaaS—Sentinel. Does it need CONTEXT XDR doesn't have? HR termination, business logic—Sentinel. Does it need CORRELATION across 3+ sources? Sentinel. Pure endpoint attack? XDR."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "xdr detection examples", "what does mde detect", "defender detections", "examples xdr handles"

"Malicious PowerShell with AMSI integration. LSASS credential dumping with kernel-level visibility. Phishing attachments with MDO sandbox. Pass-the-Hash with MDI behavioral detection. Impossible travel. Ransomware encryption behavior. These retire from SIEM—XDR handles them better."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "sentinel detection examples", "what needs siem", "custom sentinel", "examples sentinel handles"

"Terminated employee accessing data—needs HR feed. VPN from unusual country plus file download—cross-domain correlation. Service account used interactively—identity governance. Firewall blocked-then-allowed pattern. MFA reset plus password change plus new device in one hour—higher-order correlation."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WINDOWS / NETWORK / PROTOCOLS ANSWERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "windows events", "event ids", "windows logging", "security events", "critical events"

"4624/4625 for logon, 4688 for process creation with command line, 4720 for user creation, 7045 for service installation, 1102 for log clearing. But MDE captures this better—it sees the process chain and behavioral context, not just individual events."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "lateral movement", "detect lateral", "smb detection", "psexec detection", "moving laterally"

"For MDE-covered endpoints, XDR handles it—SMB abuse, RDP pivoting, WMI execution, PsExec patterns. MDE sees actual process chain and behavioral intent. Sentinel adds value for lateral movement involving non-MDE systems, or correlation with network logs showing actual traffic flows."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "network monitoring", "network detection", "firewall logs", "network visibility", "network security"

"Firewall logs to Sentinel for detection rules. Defender for IoT for OT/IoT passive monitoring. NetFlow for traffic patterns. I validate logs are flowing correctly, build KQL analytics from NGFW data, and identify gaps for the network team."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "sysmon vs mde", "sysmon or defender", "do you need sysmon", "sysmon"

"MDE for everything it covers—kernel-level telemetry, behavioral detection, cloud-backed ML. Sysmon logs process creation, but MDE understands intent. Sysmon gives event ID 1; MDE gives 'Suspicious credential access.' Sysmon only for legacy systems MDE can't protect."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DEPLOYMENT & OPERATIONS ANSWERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "asr rules", "attack surface reduction", "asr deployment", "asr rollout", "asr"

"Audit, Warn, Block—in that order. 4-8 weeks per wave minimum. Build known-good baseline before enforcement. Never disrupt legitimate workflows. Once enabled a rule after one week audit, missed a Friday finance script. Now I audit 2-3 weeks to cover full business cycles."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "edr coexistence", "two edr", "migration approach", "eset and mde", "parallel edr"

"Active-active, not passive. Both ESET and MDE protecting simultaneously during migration. Real detection comparison data. Zero protection gap at any point. Remove legacy only after new is proven—we ran parallel for 90+ days."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "cutover criteria", "when to migrate", "go-live decision", "cutover timing", "when to switch"

"Gate-based, not calendar-based. 70-80% endpoint coverage, policy compliance confirmed, detection parity validated, 90 days stable telemetry. Cutover when ready, not when planned. Legacy stays until new is proven."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "soc transition", "train soc", "analyst transition", "new siem training", "soc training"

"Parallel operations—both SIEMs running. KQL training before switch. Unified queue in M365 Defender as primary investigation point. Legacy stays until new is proven. Created runbooks and documentation for SOC during transition."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "incident response", "investigate alerts", "incident handling", "alert investigation", "handle incidents"

"Investigate in XDR—raw telemetry lives there. Correlate in Sentinel for broader context. Check device timeline, user context, parent process. Scope before you contain. Single events aren't interesting, sequences are."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCRIPTING & QUERY LANGUAGE ANSWERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "kql vs spl", "splunk vs sentinel query", "query language", "spl vs kql"

"SPL is pipe-based like Unix, KQL is more SQL-like. Different syntax, same concepts. I work primarily in KQL—DeviceProcessEvents, SigninLogs, custom analytics. Detection logic transfers—time windows, aggregations, joins, thresholds. Foundational SPL from Cognizant."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "automation", "soar", "automate security", "playbooks", "logic apps"

"Logic Apps for SOAR playbooks—auto-enrichment, ticket creation, containment actions. PowerShell for admin tasks like bulk policy updates. Python for data processing—built compliance tracker at Infosys using FireEye API. Automate repetitive, keep humans for judgment calls."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "kql technique", "favorite query", "kql tip", "advanced kql", "kql experience"

"Lookback joins with ago() and join kind=inner. Find event A, then look for event B in a time window. That's where correlation becomes powerful—single events aren't interesting, sequences are. Also summarize and arg_max for deduplication."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "kql experience", "kql skills", "query language experience", "describe kql"

"KQL is my primary query language—I use it daily. Detection rules using DeviceProcessEvents, SigninLogs, SecurityAlert. Threat hunting with ad-hoc queries. Advanced hunting in MDE with cross-table joins. Translated NetWitness rules to KQL during migration."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SOC MATURITY & ASSESSMENT ANSWERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "soc maturity", "assess soc", "maturity assessment", "soc evaluation", "maturity model"

"Four dimensions: People—team size, skills, coverage. Process—playbooks, incident response, metrics. Technology—SIEM, EDR, SOAR, detection coverage. Governance—policies, compliance, KPIs. Rate each 1-5, identify gaps, create roadmap with quick wins and long-term initiatives."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "deliverables", "documentation", "what do you document", "reports", "what did you create"

"Assessment reports with gap analysis. Roadmaps with phases and milestones. Executive summaries for leadership. Technical design documents. Runbooks for SOC procedures. Training materials for transitions. Created MDE onboarding runbooks still used today."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "client communication", "stakeholder", "present to leadership", "communicate with clients"

"Set expectations upfront—timeline, risks, dependencies. Translate technical to business—'This saves $38K/month' not 'This reduces ingestion.' Weekly status updates. Escalate blockers early. Present options with cost-benefit so they can make informed decisions."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TROUBLESHOOTING ANSWERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "mde not in sentinel", "alerts missing", "connector issue", "no alerts in sentinel"

"Check pipeline step by step. Connector status in Data Connectors—is it healthy? Permissions—SecurityReader minimum. Query SecurityAlert for recent data. If connector healthy but no data, check filtering. Usually permissions or connector needs reconnecting."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "asr blocking", "false positive asr", "legitimate app blocked", "asr exclusion"

"Confirm it's actually legitimate—verify with app owner. Create targeted exclusion—certificate-based if signed, hash, or file path as last resort. Document business justification and get sign-off. Never disable entire rule. Every exclusion is an accepted risk."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "not reporting", "no sensor data", "mde onboarding issue", "devices missing", "endpoints not reporting"

"Segment the problem—check by OS, department, location. Common causes: onboarding package never deployed, connectivity blocked, conflicting security software, machines offline. Run MDE Client Analyzer on samples. Had 50 devices with ESET conflict—configured passive mode, documented in runbook."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "duplicate events", "duplicate logs", "double ingestion"

"Duplicates usually mean multiple collection paths. Check if both legacy agent AND AMA are running. Or multiple DCRs targeting same source. Query by _ResourceId to identify pattern. Consolidate to single collection path."

SCENARIO ANSWERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "powershell alert", "investigate powershell", "suspicious script", "suspicious powershell"

"Start in XDR, not Sentinel—MDE has the process tree. Check command line for encoded commands or download cradles. Look at parent process—did Word or Outlook spawn it? Check user context. Scope—did this happen on other machines? Contain if malicious, document if false positive."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "zero day", "log4shell", "new vulnerability", "emergency response", "zero-day"

"Three parallel tracks. Track 1: Exposure assessment—TVM query, asset inventory, what's internet-facing. Track 2: Detection—IOCs into threat intel, network patterns, endpoint hunting. Track 3: Historical hunting—exploitation before disclosure? Status updates every 2 hours."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "high volume logs", "expensive logs", "too much data", "log volume", "500gb"

"First question: what detections require this data? Filter at source in DCR—maybe 500GB becomes 50GB of security-relevant events. Use Basic tier for search-only. Have the business conversation: full visibility costs $365K/year, targeted costs $36K."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "beaconing", "c2 traffic", "periodic connections", "callback", "beacon"

"Beaconing is classic C2. Identify the process making connections—correlate network logs with MDE. Check destination against threat intel. Analyze characteristics—perfect 30-second interval is scripted, slight jitter is sophisticated C2. If suspicious, isolate immediately."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "insider threat", "terminated employee", "data theft", "employee leaving"

"Needs business context XDR doesn't have. HR feed flags user as termination pending, added to watchlist. Correlate against behaviors: bulk downloads, SharePoint spikes, email forwarding to personal, USB activity. Alert goes to HR and Security, not just SOC."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "difficult problem", "challenging situation", "problem you solved", "technical challenge"

"About 50 devices showing 'No sensor data' in MDE. Investigated logs, agent health, network connectivity. Found ESET real-time protection conflicting with MDE sensor. Configured ESET passive mode, added exclusions. Documented in runbook—that runbook has been used multiple times since."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "disagreement", "conflict", "different opinion", "pushback"

"IT Ops deployed golden image with MDE agent—devices got duplicate IDs. They wanted to re-image 50+ machines. I proposed offboard/re-onboard instead. Tested on 5 pilots, each got unique ID. Created remediation script, updated SOP. IT Ops appreciated less disruptive approach."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "failure", "mistake", "something went wrong", "lesson learned", "time you failed"

"Enabled ASR rule blocking unsigned PowerShell—tested one week, looked clean. Week later, Finance's weekly Friday script failed. Missed my audit window. Fixed with exclusion, helped them sign the script. Process improvement: now audit 2-3 weeks to cover full business cycles."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "strengths", "what are you good at", "best qualities", "your strengths"

"When I fix something, I make sure the team never solves it twice—ESET runbook still used today. I connect security to business requirements—explain why it matters in their terms. I stay curious—build security tools on my own time because that's how I learn."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "weakness", "area to improve", "development area", "your weakness"

"Early in my career, I'd try to solve problems alone before asking for help. Learned that reaching out earlier gets to the solution faster. Now I spend 30 minutes on my own, then reach out. It's efficiency, not weakness."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "first 30 days", "first month", "how would you start", "onboarding"

"Week 1: Meet team, get tool access, review docs. Week 2: Shadow workflows, review recent incidents, identify quick wins. Week 3-4: Pick one thing to improve, build relationships, propose 90-day plan. First 30 days is listening, learning, earning trust—not changing everything."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "why leaving", "why looking", "why change jobs", "leaving current role"

"I've learned a lot—MDE, Sentinel, DLP—but looking for the next challenge. Want to work on more complex environments, different security domains. Looking for growth in detection engineering and consulting. Not about leaving—it's the right next step."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "why us", "why this role", "why accenture", "why consulting", "why this company"

"The consulting aspect excites me—assessing client environments, identifying gaps, delivering recommendations. That's what I've been doing internally at Siemens. Want to apply that client-facing, work on diverse environments. The scale and variety here is the challenge I'm looking for."

DLP ANSWERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "what is dlp", "explain dlp", "data loss prevention", "dlp basics"

"DLP prevents sensitive data from leaving through unauthorized channels. Classifies data—SITs, sensitivity labels, regex patterns. Monitors channels—endpoints, email, cloud apps, USB. Enforcement actions—audit, warn, or block. I supported Symantec to Purview migration—policy translation and enforcement rollout."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "dlp experience", "purview experience", "symantec dlp", "your dlp work"

"Supported Symantec to Purview migration—joined during pilot. SITs, EDMs, labels were already configured. My work was policy translation—Symantec rule-based to Purview condition-based. Ran parallel comparisons, validated detection parity. Managed enforcement rollout—audit to warn to block."

EDR/XDR ANSWERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "edr vs xdr", "difference edr xdr", "what is xdr", "edr xdr"

"EDR focuses on endpoints—process execution, file activity, network connections. XDR extends across multiple layers—correlates endpoint plus email plus identity plus cloud into unified detection. Value of XDR is you see full attack chain, not pieces. MDE with M365 Defender becomes XDR."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "mde experience", "defender experience", "endpoint security experience", "your mde work"

"MDE is my primary responsibility. Agent onboarding across 9,000 endpoints. Policy configuration—ASR rules, network protection, device control. Exclusion management with documentation. Troubleshooting agent health. Sentinel integration via M365 connector. Custom KQL using DeviceProcessEvents."

VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT ANSWERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "prioritize vulnerabilities", "vulnerability management", "cvss", "epss", "vuln prioritization"

"Not every critical CVE is actually critical—context matters. CVSS tells severity—how bad if exploited. EPSS tells urgency—likelihood of exploitation. Asset context—crown jewel or test server. Compensating controls—segmentation, WAF, EDR coverage. Built Sentinel rules correlating TVM and Qualys with this logic."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRIGGERS: "threat intelligence", "threat intel", "ioc", "feeds", "ti effectiveness"

"Measure threat intel by whether it improves detection—not how many feeds. Enrichment—how many alerts matched IOCs. Relevance—true positive rate. Operational—did it lead to faster containment. Timeliness—late intel is useless. Used this approach with MDE and Sentinel."
