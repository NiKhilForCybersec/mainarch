            <pre><code>"I have about five years of experience in cybersecurity, primarily across 
SIEM, detection engineering, and endpoint security, working in both SOC 
and security engineering roles.

I started my career as a SOC Analyst at Cognizant, where I worked with 
Splunk on alert triage, incident investigations, and log analysis. That 
role gave me a strong foundation in how detections are used operationally, 
what analysts need to investigate alerts efficiently, and how noisy 
detections impact a SOC. While my Splunk experience there was primarily 
from the analyst and consumer side rather than platform administration, 
it gave me solid foundational knowledge of SPL, dashboards, and how 
Splunk fits into security operations.

I then moved into security engineering at Infosys, where I worked with 
enterprise security platforms such as the FireEye stack — HX, NX, and EX — 
as well as Symantec DLP. My responsibilities included agent deployments, 
onboarding and troubleshooting telemetry, supporting security operations, 
and participating in security tool evaluations and proof-of-concepts, 
including an EDR migration project.

After relocating to Canada, I joined a Siemens subsidiary, where my focus 
shifted more toward SIEM and platform engineering. I was involved in a 
migration from RSA NetWitness to Microsoft Sentinel, contributing from 
the discovery and foundation phase — log source identification, ingestion 
strategy, onboarding data using built-in and custom connectors, and 
validating data quality for detection use cases. In parallel, I led the 
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint track, handling agent onboarding, policy 
configuration, exclusions, and stabilization to ensure reliable endpoint 
telemetry integrated with Sentinel.

More recently, I've been supporting a DLP migration from Symantec to 
Microsoft Purview, mainly around policy translation and audit-mode 
validation.

Overall, my experience sits at the intersection of SIEM engineering, 
endpoint security, and detection alignment. While my hands-on SIEM 
deployment experience is primarily with Sentinel, the core concepts — 
log ingestion, parsing, detection engineering, SOC enablement — translate 
directly. I'm confident in my ability to work with Splunk deployments 
given my foundational knowledge and the transferable skills from my 
Sentinel work."</code></pre>

            <pre><code>"Currently, I'm in the final wind-up phase of a security transformation 
project. The main tracks — SIEM, EDR, and DLP — are all complete, and 
I've recently moved to the DLP track to support knowledge transfer 
and handover to the internal security team. Day-to-day right now involves 
finalizing documentation, conducting KT sessions, and ensuring the 
internal team is ready to take over operations.

Before this handover phase, my primary focus was SIEM and EDR. Identity 
and Infrastructure migrations had already started before I joined — they 
were the cloud foundation that needed to be in place first. I joined when 
the security tracks began at M1.

During SIEM discovery, I was meeting with log source owners, configuring 
connectors and DCRs, validating data quality, and troubleshooting ingestion 
issues. For MDE, I coordinated deployment waves with IT, monitored onboarding 
status, configured ASR rules, and managed exclusions based on application 
team requests.

DLP started later at M6 because it needs more groundwork — legal alignment, 
cross-team coordination, data classification. We migrated Symantec Endpoint 
DLP to Purview. Symantec Network DLP continues for now; the plan is to 
discontinue it after complete Azure transformation.

Throughout all phases, I collaborated closely with SOC teams — they're 
the consumers of our telemetry and detections. I also worked with business 
stakeholders when we needed to understand workflows for tuning or exclusions.

The common thread across all my work is ensuring security platforms are 
deployed in a controlled, scalable way with reliable telemetry — and now, 
ensuring that knowledge transfers cleanly to the team that will run it."</code></pre>

            <pre><code>"I'll walk you through the RSA NetWitness to Microsoft Sentinel migration 
I worked on. The company was a B2B SaaS provider with about 4,000 employees, 
9,000 endpoints, and global offices.

CONTEXT: This was part of a larger cloud transformation. Identity and 
Infrastructure migrations had already started — AD was being synced to 
Entra ID, Azure landing zone was in place. Once that foundation was ready, 
the security tracks began. I joined when SIEM and EDR started at M1. 
DLP came later at M6 because it needs more groundwork — legal alignment, 
cross-team coordination, data classification.

DISCOVERY: We started by documenting the existing RSA environment — what 
log sources were configured, what parsers were in use, what detection rules 
existed. I met with IT, infrastructure, and application teams to understand 
their logging capabilities.

LOG SOURCE STRATEGY: This is where migrating to Sentinel with XDR is 
fundamentally different from a traditional SIEM migration. RSA NetWitness 
is purely log-driven — you ingest everything and build detections on raw 
logs. With Sentinel + Defender XDR, the detection model shifts completely.

XDR handles most attack detections natively — endpoint threats, email 
phishing, identity attacks, cloud app anomalies — all detected by Defender 
products without needing raw logs in Sentinel. So instead of asking 
'what logs do we need for detection?', the question becomes 'what does 
XDR NOT cover that Sentinel needs to see?'

We prioritized: Identity control-plane logs first (Entra ID AuditLogs, 
SigninLogs) because XDR detects identity ATTACKS but not CHANGES like 
role assignments or CA policy modifications. Then XDR alerts and incidents 
via the M365 Defender connector — this is how attack detections flow to 
Sentinel for correlation. Then sources XDR doesn't cover: network logs, 
SaaS audit logs, on-prem infrastructure.

INGESTION: For each source, I configured the appropriate connector — built-in 
where available, custom DCRs for on-prem sources. We validated data quality: 
are fields parsing correctly? Are timestamps accurate? Is the volume expected?

DETECTION ALIGNMENT: Because XDR handles most attack detection, our Sentinel 
rules focused on three areas: (1) correlating XDR alerts with other signals, 
(2) detecting control-plane changes XDR doesn't see, and (3) coverage for 
sources outside the Defender ecosystem. We enabled built-in rules from 
Content Hub and translated RSA rules only where we had genuine gaps.

PARALLEL OPERATIONS & CUTOVER:
We ran RSA and Sentinel in parallel for several months. Sentinel became the 
primary SIEM only after all critical log sources were onboarded and we had 
more than 90 days of stable telemetry for baselining and tuning.

Similarly, MDE became the primary EDR once we reached around 70-80% endpoint 
onboarding and policy compliance.

This approach avoided blind spots, validated detections, and transitioned 
the SOC safely without operational risk.

CURRENT STATE: All tracks complete. RSA and ESET decommissioned. Currently 
in final handover phase with knowledge transfer to internal team."</code></pre>

            <pre><code>"My approach starts with a critical distinction that drives all ingestion 
decisions: Defender products detect ATTACKS; Entra ID logs record CHANGES.

MDI detects Pass-the-Hash, but it doesn't log who was added to Global 
Admins — that comes from Entra ID AuditLogs. Understanding this separation 
determines your entire log strategy.

PRIORITY 0 — WHAT XDR DOESN'T PROVIDE (Must Ingest Separately)
  1. ENTRA ID LOGS (AuditLogs, SigninLogs)
     User creation, group changes, role assignments, CA policy changes.
     XDR detects identity ATTACKS but NOT control-plane CHANGES.
     
  2. OFFICE ACTIVITY
     SharePoint permissions, Exchange admin, mailbox forwarding.
     MDO detects phishing but NOT mailbox permission changes.

PRIORITY 1 — XDR ALERTS & INCIDENTS (Low Volume, High Value)
  • SecurityAlert, SecurityIncident from M365 Defender connector
  • This is how XDR attack detections flow into Sentinel
  • ~$50/month, NOT $15K/month for raw telemetry

PRIORITY 2 — WHAT XDR DOESN'T COVER
  • Network: Palo Alto firewall, VPN logs, DNS — XDR is endpoint-focused
  • SaaS apps: Salesforce, Workday, NetSuite — outside Defender scope
  • Tier 0 servers: Domain Controllers, Certificate Authority

PRIORITY 3 — SELECTIVE FORENSICS (Basic Tier)
  • High-volume, low-query: Firewall traffic, NSG flows, VPC flows
  • Use Basic tier (~$0.50/GB vs $2.76/GB)

WHAT WE DON'T INGEST:
  • MDE raw telemetry (DeviceProcessEvents, DeviceFileEvents, etc.)
  • Query these in XDR Advanced Hunting at no extra cost
  • Ingesting would cost ~$15K/month and duplicate XDR detection

The key insight: Understand what XDR provides (attack detection) vs 
what it doesn't (control-plane changes), then fill the gaps selectively."</code></pre>

            <pre><code>"In my recent project, I worked with both built-in Sentinel connectors 
and custom log onboarding, depending on the source and complexity.

BUILT-IN CONNECTORS (Straightforward):
• Microsoft Entra ID — Diagnostic settings to Log Analytics workspace, 
  immediate well-structured telemetry
• Microsoft 365 Defender — Content Hub XDR solution for Device* tables, 
  free ingestion
• Azure Activity Logs — Subscription-level diagnostic settings
• AWS CloudTrail — S3 connector with SQS notifications for reliable ingestion

These provided immediate, well-structured telemetry with minimal configuration.

CUSTOM ONBOARDING (More Involved):

Windows Servers:
• Azure Monitor Agent with Data Collection Rules
• Filtered to specific security Event IDs (4624, 4625, 4688) to control 
  volume and focus on detection-relevant telemetry

Linux Servers:
• Cloud-connected: AMA with syslog DCRs
• Legacy/constrained environments: Dedicated syslog aggregation server, 
  forwarded logs centrally rather than installing agents everywhere
• Required troubleshooting rsyslog configurations and normalizing formats

On-Prem Firewalls (CEF):
• CEF logs via AMA
• Worked closely with network team to configure syslog forwarding
• Encountered non-standard CEF extensions requiring custom parsing and 
  field normalization to align with CommonSecurityLog

Custom Application Logs:
• Initially used HTTP Data Collector API
• Later migrated to DCR-based ingestion once formats were standardized
• Required coordination with dev teams to ensure consistent JSON structures

VALIDATION APPROACH (Same for All Sources):
• Confirm data flow (is it arriving?)
• Verify field parsing (are fields populated correctly?)
• Check volume against expectations
• Ensure data is usable for detection and correlation — not just present 
  in the workspace"</code></pre>

detects ATTACKS but does NOT provide control-plane audit logs:

MDI (DEFENDER FOR IDENTITY):
  Detects: Pass-the-Hash, Kerberoasting, DCSync, Golden Ticket, 
           lateral movement, LDAP reconnaissance
  Does NOT provide: User creation logs, group membership changes, 
           role assignments, password resets

  Example: MDI alerts on Pass-the-Hash attack. But if you ask 'who added 
  this user to Domain Admins?' — that's in Entra ID AuditLogs, not MDI.

MDO (DEFENDER FOR OFFICE 365):
  Detects: Phishing campaigns, malicious attachments/URLs, BEC, 
           impersonation attacks
  Does NOT provide: Mailbox permission changes, transport rule changes,
           mailbox forwarding rule audits

  Example: MDO catches phishing email. But 'who set up this inbox 
  forwarding rule?' — that's in OfficeActivity, not MDO.

MDE (DEFENDER FOR ENDPOINT):
  Detects: Malware, ransomware, LOLBins, credential theft (LSASS), 
           persistence mechanisms, exploit activity
  Does NOT provide: Device join audits, Entra ID role assignments,
           Intune compliance changes

  Example: MDE detects LSASS access. But 'who enrolled this device?' — 
  that's in IntuneAuditLogs or AuditLogs.

MDA (DEFENDER FOR CLOUD APPS):
  Detects: Impossible travel, risky OAuth consent, shadow IT, 
           mass file downloads, suspicious inbox rules
  Does NOT provide: App registration audit logs, consent change history,
           tenant configuration changes

  Example: MDA flags impossible travel. But 'who registered this app 
  in our tenant?' — that's in AuditLogs.

THE IMPLICATION:
Even with full XDR deployment, you MUST separately ingest Entra ID 
diagnostic logs (AuditLogs, SigninLogs) for:
  • Compliance audits ('Show all Global Admin changes last 90 days')
  • Investigation context ('Was MFA just changed for this user?')
  • Identity governance ('Who has admin and when was it assigned?')

XDR + Sentinel = XDR for attack detection, Sentinel for correlation 
with control-plane changes that XDR doesn't provide."</code></pre>

2. FIELD COMPLETENESS

   • Any timezone conversion issues?

4. USE-CASE READINESS

          <h3>7. How do you manage SIEM ingestion cost?</h3>
          <p class="interview-context"><strong>Very common for Sentinel roles.</strong> Filtering, prioritization, XDR-first approach, retention strategy.</p>
          
          <div class="code-block">
            <div class="code-header"><span class="code-lang">Response</span></div>
            <pre><code>"Cost management is critical with Sentinel's per-GB pricing. Here's my approach:

1. XDR-FIRST SELECTIVE INGESTION (Biggest Optimization)
   • With XDR enabled, we consume XDR incidents — NOT all raw Device* tables
   • XDR already correlates endpoint telemetry into high-fidelity incidents
   • Ingesting all Device* tables duplicates detection and wastes storage
   
   Before (naive): All Device* tables — ~150 GB/day
   After (XDR-first): XDR incidents + 1 selective table — ~25 GB/day
   
   80% reduction in endpoint data volume. Even with 'free' ingestion, 
   storage and compute costs add up.

2. LEVERAGE FREE DATA STRATEGICALLY
   • XDR incidents (SecurityIncident, SecurityAlert) — free
   • Azure Activity Logs — free
   • Defender for Cloud alerts — free
   • Microsoft Sentinel benefit with M365 E5 — 5 MB/user/day free grant
   
   Key insight: Just because Device* tables are 'free to ingest' doesn't 
   mean you should ingest them. XDR handles that detection.

3. COMMITMENT TIERS (Major Savings)
   Sentinel offers tiered pricing with significant discounts:
   
   | Tier         | Discount vs Pay-As-You-Go |
   |--------------|---------------------------|
   | 100 GB/day   | ~50% savings              |
   | 200 GB/day   | ~55% savings              |
   | 400 GB/day   | ~60% savings              |
   | 500+ GB/day  | ~65% savings              |
   
   We use 100 GB/day commitment tier. Monitor usage weekly.

4. FILTER AT INGESTION, NOT AFTER
   • Data Collection Rules to filter Windows events to security-relevant IDs
   • Don't ingest verbose debug logs — filter at source
   • NSG flow logs: selective subnets, not everything

5. USE APPROPRIATE LOG TIERS
   • Analytics tier: Data you query frequently (detections, investigations)
   • Basic tier: High-volume, low-query data — 50% cheaper than Analytics
   • Archive tier: Long-term retention for compliance — cheapest storage

6. RETENTION STRATEGY
   • 90 days hot retention for most tables (default)
   • Archive beyond 90 days for compliance requirements
   • Some high-volume tables (NSG flows): 30 days only

7. COST MONITORING
   • Weekly review of ingestion by table using Usage workbook
   • Alert on unexpected volume spikes (>20% above baseline)
   • Identify tables growing faster than expected

RESULT:
• Sentinel cost: ~$12,000/month (with commitment tier)
• Legacy RSA NetWitness: ~$35,000/month
• Savings: 66% cost reduction with improved detection coverage"</code></pre>

            <div class="code-header"><span class="code-lang">Response</span></div>
            <pre><code>"Our approach depends on client requirements:

IF CLIENT CONTRACT MANDATES LOGS STAY IN EU:
• Deploy a separate Sentinel workspace in an EU region (e.g., West Europe)
• Replicate detection logic through a Git-based deployment model
• All analytics rules, workbooks, and playbooks are stored in a central 
  Git repository and deployed consistently across workspaces
• Data never leaves EU boundaries — the workspace is entirely EU-resident
• This adds operational overhead (managing multiple workspaces) but 
  guarantees compliance with strict residency requirements

IF NO STRICT RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT:
• Centralize logging in primary workspace (typically US or closest region)
• Rely on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for cross-border data transfers
• SCCs are Microsoft's mechanism for GDPR-compliant data transfers to US
• Implement additional controls to meet GDPR obligations:
  - RBAC: Role-based access to ensure only authorized personnel access data
  - Auditing: Log access and query activity
  - Retention controls: Data retention policies aligned with compliance needs
  - Data minimization: Only collect what's necessary for security use cases

WHY THIS MATTERS:
• GDPR Article 44+ governs cross-border data transfers
• Some industries (healthcare, government, financial services) have 
  stricter requirements beyond GDPR
• Getting this wrong can result in regulatory penalties and contract breaches

GIT-BASED DEPLOYMENT MODEL:
When we have multi-region workspaces, we use Infrastructure-as-Code:
• Analytics rules defined as ARM/Bicep templates or YAML
• CI/CD pipeline deploys rules to all workspaces consistently
• Version control for all detection logic
• Ensures rule parity across regions without manual duplication

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Check client contract for explicit residency clauses
2. Check industry regulations (HIPAA, PCI, local laws)
3. If strict → separate workspace in compliant region
4. If flexible → centralize with SCCs + controls
5. Document the decision and controls applied"</code></pre>

2. MAP TO THREAT SCENARIOS

   • AuditLogs for sensitive actions ✓
   • RiskySignIns for Microsoft's ML signals ✓

   • Enable and tune thresholds
   • Custom KQL only if no native equivalent

6. VALIDATE
   • Does it fire on known-bad scenarios?

            <pre><code>"Yes, but practically — not as a checkbox exercise. Here's how I actually use it:

1. DETECTION COVERAGE MAPPING
   When we migrated from RSA to Sentinel, I mapped our existing detections 
   to ATT&CK techniques. This showed us:
   • Where we had strong coverage (Initial Access, Credential Access)
   • Where we had gaps (Defense Evasion, Lateral Movement)
   
2. PRIORITIZING NEW DETECTIONS
   Instead of trying to cover all 200+ techniques, I prioritize based on:
   • Relevance to our environment (cloud-first = focus on T1078 Valid Accounts)
   • Telemetry availability (can we actually detect it?)
   • Attack prevalence (what are threat actors actually using?)

3. CONTENT HUB ALIGNMENT
   Microsoft's Content Hub solutions map to ATT&CK. When enabling built-in 
   rules, I check which techniques they cover and whether those align with 
   our priority gaps.

4. PRACTICAL EXAMPLE
   For T1078.004 (Cloud Accounts), we implemented:
   • Impossible travel detection (built-in, tuned threshold)
   • Sign-in from anonymous IP (built-in)
   • Service principal added to privileged role (custom)
   
   Each maps to a specific sub-technique with clear detection logic.

5. GAP COMMUNICATION
   MITRE mapping helps communicate with leadership:
   "We have coverage for 15 of the 20 techniques most relevant to our 
   threat model. Here are the 5 gaps and what we need to close them."

I don't aim for 100% coverage — I aim for coverage where it matters for 
our specific risk profile."</code></pre>

            <pre><code>"My default is built-in first, custom only when necessary. Here's my framework:

USE BUILT-IN WHEN:
• Microsoft provides a native equivalent (Content Hub)
• The detection logic is well-maintained by the vendor
• It covers common attack patterns (credential attacks, malware, etc.)
• You want automatic updates when new threats emerge

Example: I enabled Microsoft's "Possible AiTM phishing attempt" detection 
rather than writing custom KQL. Microsoft has more threat intel and updates 
it constantly.

USE CUSTOM WHEN:
• Business-specific logic (our Salesforce data export patterns)
• Environment-specific thresholds (what's "normal" for us)
• No built-in equivalent exists
• Need to correlate across sources in a specific way

Example: We wrote custom KQL for "Service principal granted privileged role 
outside change window" — this requires knowing our change windows.

MY DECISION PROCESS:
1. Check Content Hub — is there a solution for this use case?
2. Enable and test built-in rules — do they work in our environment?
3. Tune thresholds — Microsoft defaults are often too sensitive
4. Custom only for gaps — document why built-in didn't work

MAINTAINABILITY MATTERS:
• Built-in rules: Microsoft maintains, you tune
• Custom rules: You maintain forever
• Every custom rule is technical debt

In our migration, about 70% of detections came from built-in rules (enabled 
and tuned), 30% were custom for environment-specific needs."</code></pre>

THE OLD MODEL (SIEM-First):
• You write low-level rules for everything
• Process + network + file activity = correlate yourself
• High rule count, high maintenance, lots of false positives

THE NEW MODEL (XDR-First):
• XDR handles attack detection across endpoint, identity, email, cloud
• XDR correlates automatically with ML and threat intel
• You focus on correlation XDR CAN'T do and business-specific gaps

WHAT XDR HANDLES (Don't Write These):
• Malware detection, ransomware behavior, LOLBins abuse (MDE)
• Phishing, BEC, malicious attachments (MDO)
• Credential attacks, lateral movement (MDI)
• Risky app consent, impossible travel (MDA)
• Cross-product correlation (XDR unified incidents)

WHAT YOU STILL WRITE (Sentinel Custom Rules):
1. XDR alert + identity change correlation
   'XDR alert fired AND MFA method changed in last 24 hours'
   
2. SaaS app monitoring outside Defender scope
   'Salesforce bulk export by user not in data-team group'
   
3. Network correlation
   'XDR alert + connection to IP on threat intel watchlist'
   
4. Business-specific logic
   'Wire transfer approval after hours from non-finance user'

RULE DISPOSITION IN MIGRATION:
When we migrated 187 legacy RSA rules:
• 60% RETIRED — XDR handles natively (don't recreate)
• 20% REPLACED — XDR equivalent exists (use XDR)
• 17% REBUILT — Still needed, rewrite in KQL for gaps
• 3% DEPRECATED — Obsolete, no longer relevant

The key insight: Detection engineering shifts from 'write everything' 
to 'design the strategy'. You decide what XDR handles vs what needs 
custom rules. That's higher-value work."</code></pre>

   • Verify alert fires within expected time
   • Check alert has necessary context for investigation
   
   Example: Test ASR rule detection by triggering blocked action on test machine

3. PURPLE TEAM VALIDATION

   • Work with red team to simulate specific techniques
   • Validate detection fires correctly
   • Tune if it misses or over-fires

4. SOC FEEDBACK LOOP
   Once detection is live:
   • Monitor alert volume for first 48-72 hours
   • Review false positive rate with analysts
   • Tune thresholds based on real-world data

5. ONGOING VALIDATION
   • Weekly review of detection performance
   • Track: Alerts generated, incidents created, true positive rate

   • Parent-child process relationships
   • User context

4. DeviceFileEvents / DeviceRegistryEvents
   • File changes, registry modifications

XDR HANDLES (Don't Ingest to Sentinel):
• MDE correlates these tables automatically
• ML models detect malware, ransomware, credential theft
• Produces SecurityAlert, SecurityIncident in Sentinel
• Query raw data in XDR Advanced Hunting when investigating

SENTINEL HANDLES (After XDR Alert):

• Correlate XDR alert with network/SaaS logs
• Business-specific rules XDR can't do

• Event-based: specific Event IDs for specific actions
• Examples: 4624 (logon), 4688 (process creation), 4625 (failed logon)
• Limitations:
  - Command line logging requires GPO configuration
  - No automatic process ancestry
  - Can be disabled by attackers with admin rights
• Cost: You pay for ingestion

EDR TELEMETRY (MDE Device* tables):
• Agent-based — richer behavioral context
• Continuous monitoring, not just events
• Automatic process trees and ancestry
• Harder for attackers to evade (kernel-level hooks)
• Built-in threat intelligence enrichment
• Cost: FREE through M365 Defender connector

WHEN I USE EACH:

Windows Events:
• Servers without MDE (legacy, air-gapped)
• Specific audit requirements (4769 for Kerberos)
• Domain controller events (not always MDE-enrolled)
• Compliance requirements that specify Windows logging

EDR Telemetry:
• Primary detection source for endpoints
• Process-based detections
• Network connection context
• File and registry activity
• Anything behavioral

COST TRADE-OFF:
With MDE, I get richer telemetry for free. Windows Security Events

          <div class="code-block">
            <div class="code-header"><span class="code-lang">Response</span></div>
            <pre><code>"At a detection-relevant level:

TCP/IP BASICS FOR SECURITY:
• IP addresses identify hosts (source/destination)
• Ports identify services (80=HTTP, 443=HTTPS, 445=SMB)
• TCP = connection-oriented (handshake, reliable)
• UDP = connectionless (DNS, faster but no guarantee)

HOW THIS IMPACTS DETECTIONS:

1. UNUSUAL PORTS
   Normal: Outbound 443, 80
   Suspicious: Outbound 4444 (Metasploit default), 8080 to internet
   
   Detection: Process making outbound connection on non-standard port

2. DNS AS DETECTION SIGNAL
   • DNS queries happen before connections
   • Can detect C2 domains before payload executes
   • DNS tunneling uses TXT records or long subdomains
   
   Detection: Unusually long DNS queries, high query volume to single domain

3. LATERAL MOVEMENT PATTERNS
   • SMB (445) between workstations = suspicious
   • RDP (3389) from workstation to server = maybe normal
   • WinRM (5985/5986) from non-admin machine = suspicious
   
   Detection: Workstation-to-workstation SMB connections

4. NETWORK BOUNDARIES
   • Internal to internal (lateral movement)
   • Internal to external (exfiltration, C2)
   • External to internal (initial access, if exposed)
   
   Detection logic changes based on direction

5. BEACONING PATTERNS
   • C2 often has regular callback intervals
   • TCP connections to same IP at consistent intervals
   
   Detection: Regular outbound connections with consistent timing

For Sentinel, this translates to:
• DeviceNetworkEvents: process-to-network correlation
• CommonSecurityLog: firewall allow/deny with IP/port
• DnsEvents: query patterns
• AzureNetworkAnalytics: flow logs for cloud workloads"</code></pre>

            <pre><code>"I think in terms of the three planes, plus perimeter:

1. PERIMETER (Traditional Boundary)
   • Firewall — allow/deny based on IP, port, protocol
   • WAF — protect web applications from OWASP top 10
   • Email gateway — filter phishing and malware
   • DDoS protection — volumetric attack mitigation
   
   Reality: Perimeter is less relevant with cloud and remote work. 
   Still important but not the primary control anymore.

2. IDENTITY PLANE (Most Critical)
   • Conditional Access — device, location, risk-based access
   • MFA — everywhere, especially privileged accounts
   • PIM — just-in-time privileged access
   • Identity Protection — risk-based sign-in policies
   
   "Identity is the new perimeter" — this is where most attacks start.

3. DATA PLANE (Where Business Runs)
   • Endpoint: MDE for detection and response, ASR for prevention
   • Email: Defender for Office 365, Safe Attachments/Links
   • SaaS: Cloud App Security, session controls
   • Data: DLP policies, sensitivity labels, encryption

4. CLOUD CONTROL PLANE
   • Azure Policy — enforce configurations
   • Defender for Cloud — posture management
   • RBAC — least privilege access to resources
   • Management plane protection — PIM for Azure roles

FOR DETECTION (SIEM PERSPECTIVE):
I need telemetry from all layers:
• Perimeter: firewall logs, email gateway
• Identity: Entra ID logs, Conditional Access events
• Endpoint: MDE telemetry
• Cloud: Azure Activity, Defender for Cloud

Detection is strongest when I can correlate across layers:
Identity anomaly + Endpoint behavior + Network connection = High confidence"</code></pre>

            <pre><code>"As a SIEM engineer, I'm not the primary investigator, but I enable and 
support the SOC in several ways:

1. CONTEXT ENRICHMENT
   When an incident occurs, analysts often need more data. I help by:
   • Writing ad-hoc KQL queries to find related events
   • Pulling historical data they might not have access to
   • Correlating across tables they're less familiar with
   
   Example: "Can you find all activity by this user in the last 7 days?"

2. DETECTION GAP ANALYSIS
   After every significant incident, I ask:
   • Did we detect this? If not, why?
   • What telemetry was available?
   • Can we create a detection for this pattern?
   
   Example: Post-incident, we discovered we weren't logging a specific 
   API that was abused. I worked with the app team to add that telemetry.

3. PLAYBOOK VALIDATION
   • Verify that detections are feeding the right playbooks
   • Ensure entity mapping is correct for automated enrichment
   • Test that automated response actions work

4. DATA AVAILABILITY
   • Ensure retention is sufficient for investigation scope
   • Verify logs weren't dropped or delayed during incident
   • Provide access to archived data if needed

5. POST-INCIDENT IMPROVEMENTS
   Every incident is an input to detection engineering:
   • New detection rule if we missed the initial access
   • Tuned threshold if we detected but too late
   • New log source if we lacked visibility

My role is making sure the SOC has the data and tools they need, and 
that we continuously improve detection based on real incidents."</code></pre>

          <p class="interview-context"><strong>Very common question.</strong> Correlation, tuning, severity alignment, incident grouping.</p>
          
          <div class="code-block">
            <div class="code-header"><span class="code-lang">Response</span></div>
            <pre><code>"Alert fatigue is one of the biggest operational problems in security. 
Here's my approach:

1. TUNE BEFORE YOU ENABLE
   • Never enable a detection at vendor defaults without testing
   • Run in "audit mode" first — generate alerts but don't notify
   • Analyze: How many alerts per day? What's the FP rate?
   
   We reduced initial alert volume by 75% through pre-deployment tuning.

2. ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC EXCLUSIONS
   • Whitelist known-good behavior specific to your environment
   • Service accounts that legitimately do suspicious things
   • Scheduled tasks that look like persistence but aren't
   
   Example: Our backup service triggers "sensitive file access" constantly. 
   Exclude the service account, keep the detection for everyone else.

3. CORRELATION AND GROUPING
   • Use Fusion rules to combine related low-confidence signals
   • Group alerts into incidents — 10 alerts, 1 incident to triage
   • Cross-table correlation: sign-in anomaly + endpoint behavior = higher confidence

4. SEVERITY ALIGNMENT
   • Low severity = informational, doesn't page anyone
   • Medium = review during business hours
   • High = investigate within SLA
   • Critical = immediate response
   
   Be honest about severity. Not everything is critical.

5. MEASURE AND ITERATE
   • Track: Alerts/day, incidents/day, true positive rate
   • Target: <200 alerts/day, <25 incidents/day, >80% TP rate
   • Weekly review of noisy detections

6. RETIRE BAD DETECTIONS
   If a detection has <10% true positive rate after tuning, disable it. 
   A rule that generates 100 false positives and 1 true positive is 
   worse than no rule at all.

Our SOC went from 800+ alerts/day to ~150 through systematic tuning."</code></pre>

VOLUME METRICS:
• Alerts per day: ~150-200 (after tuning)
• Incidents per day: ~15-25
• Ingestion volume: ~250 GB/day
• Cost per GB: tracked monthly

QUALITY METRICS:
• True positive rate: target >80%
• Mean time to detect (MTTD): how long from event to alert?
• Mean time to respond (MTTR): ~4 hours for P2/P3
• False positive rate by detection: identify noisy rules

COVERAGE METRICS:
• Log source coverage: % of critical sources onboarded
• Detection coverage: mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
• Time to new detection: how fast can we deploy new rules?

OPERATIONAL METRICS:
• Analyst utilization: are we overwhelming or underutilizing SOC?
• Escalation rate: what % of incidents go to L3?
• Automation rate: % of alerts with automated enrichment

HOW I PRESENT THESE:
• Weekly: Alert volume, FP rate, top noisy detections
• Monthly: MTTR trends, coverage gaps, cost analysis
• Quarterly: MITRE coverage, detection effectiveness review

EXAMPLE DASHBOARD QUERY:

   Don't say: "We need to onboard your syslog to the SIEM via CEF."
   Say: "We need to connect your firewall to our monitoring system so 
   we can detect threats targeting your network."

2. FRAME IN BUSINESS TERMS
   Don't say: "This detection covers T1078 Valid Accounts."

3. USE RISK-BASED CONVERSATIONS

   compromises your application. Can you walk me through what you log

1. UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS NEED FIRST
   Before pushing back, ask: Why do they need this? What's the business 
   outcome they're trying to achieve?
   
   Often there's a secure way to achieve the same outcome.

2. QUANTIFY THE RISK
   Don't say: "That's insecure."
   Say: "If we do this, here's the specific risk: unauthorized access to 
   customer data. The likelihood is medium because..."

3. OFFER ALTERNATIVES
   "I understand you need to share files externally. Instead of disabling 
   DLP, let's create an approved channel with logging. You get your 
   functionality, we keep visibility."

4. DOCUMENT THE DECISION
   If business accepts the risk, document it:
   • What's the risk?
   • Who accepted it?
   • What compensating controls exist?
   • When do we revisit?

REAL EXAMPLE:
Application team wanted to exclude their entire server from MDE scanning 
because it was causing performance issues.

My response:
"I understand the performance concern. Let's investigate the specific 
processes causing overhead and create targeted exclusions. Full exclusion 
means we have zero visibility if that server is compromised."

We found 3 specific processes to exclude. They got their performance, 
we kept detection coverage for everything else.

THE KEY PRINCIPLE:
Security's job isn't to say no — it's to help the business achieve 
its goals securely. If we just block everything, people find workarounds 
that are even less secure."</code></pre>

an organization's architecture end-to-end, identifying gaps, and helping 
shape how security should be built — rather than just operating a single 
environment long-term.

A consulting role allows me to apply that engineering foundation across 
different environments, industries, and architectures. I like walking into 
new organizations, quickly understanding their business, control and data 
planes, and then mapping the right security controls and detection strategies 
to their risk profile.

I also feel my background fits consulting well because I've worked across 
multiple security domains — SIEM, EDR, identity, and DLP — which gives me 
a broader view of how controls work together rather than in silos.

Consulting lets me leverage that breadth, contribute earlier in design and

   • If they don't have identity logs, that's a major gap.

2. DETECTION MATURITY (Day 2-3)
   • How many active detection rules?
   • Built-in vs custom ratio?
   • When was the last rule added or tuned?
   • MITRE coverage assessment
   • Ask: "Show me your most recent detection that fired and resulted

   • True positive rate
   • MTTR for incidents
   • Analyst capacity and skill level
   • Ask: "What's your biggest operational pain point?"

4. DATA QUALITY (Day 4-5)
   • Are logs parsing correctly?
   • Any ingestion delays?
   • Retention appropriate for investigation needs?
   • Run validation queries on critical tables

5. INTEGRATION & AUTOMATION (Week 2)

I define criteria that must be met before transitioning to primary.

FOR SIEM (Sentinel):
Sentinel became primary only after:
• All critical log sources onboarded and validated
• 90+ days of stable telemetry for baselining and tuning
• Detection coverage validated against legacy platform
• SOC analysts trained and comfortable with KQL/workflows
• Playbooks tested and operational

FOR EDR (MDE):
MDE became primary once we reached:
• 70-80% endpoint onboarding coverage
• Policy compliance across onboarded devices
• ASR rules validated in audit mode
• ESET exclusions properly configured (no conflicts)
• Detection parity confirmed vs legacy EDR

PARALLEL OPERATIONS APPROACH:
We ran both platforms simultaneously during transition. This approach:
• Avoids blind spots — if one misses something, the other catches it
• Validates detection parity — compare alerts side by side
• Enables safe SOC transition — analysts can fall back if needed
• Reduces operational risk — no "big bang" cutover

The parallel period for SIEM was about 3-4 months. For EDR, it was 
the duration of the phased rollout (8-10 months) until we reached 
full coverage and started ESET removal.

The key insight: rushing cutover to save parallel licensing costs

1. DETECTION TRANSLATION PARALYSIS
   Problem: Teams try to migrate every rule 1:1 from legacy SIEM
   Reality: 60% of rules are obsolete, noisy, or have built-in equivalents
   
   Solution: Categorize rules first. Only translate what adds value.
   Many detections are better replaced by vendor-native content.

2. TELEMETRY NOT READY FOR DETECTIONS
   Problem: Detection engineers write rules, but data isn't flowing yet
   Result: Blocked work, frustration, delayed timelines
   
   Solution: Deploy telemetry sources BEFORE detection implementation.
   We started MDE rollout early specifically for this reason.

3. UNDERESTIMATING SOC TRANSITION
   Problem: "We'll just train analysts for a week"
   Reality: SOC needs months of parallel operation, shadow mode, 
   gradual confidence building
   
   Solution: Plan for 3-6 months of parallel operation. Budget for it.

4. COST SURPRISES
   Problem: Migrate everything, get shocked by bill
   Reality: Per-GB pricing adds up fast with verbose logs
   
   Solution: Instrument cost monitoring from day 1. Use free tiers 
   aggressively. Filter before ingest.

5. CUSTOM LOG SOURCE COMPLEXITY
   Problem: On-prem and custom apps are always harder than expected
   Reality: Every non-standard log source has quirks
   
   Solution: Inventory all log sources early. Identify the hard ones. 
   Build in buffer time.

6. STAKEHOLDER ALIGNMENT
   Problem: Teams surprised by new logging requirements
   Reality: You need cooperation from IT, apps, network, cloud teams
   
   Solution: Stakeholder engagement in discovery phase, not deployment.

7. UNREALISTIC TIMELINES
   Problem: "We'll migrate in 3 months"
   Reality: With XDR-first approach, enterprise SIEM migrations take 12 months
   
   Solution: Set expectations. Enable XDR from Day 1. Plan for parallel operation.

2. Build all detections — correlation searches, risk-based alerting, MITRE 
   mapping. Even 'out-of-the-box' content requires tuning and ownership.
3. Handle all correlation — Splunk has no native upstream XDR engine. 
   No automatic cross-domain ML correlation. If correlation exists, 
   you wrote it and you maintain it.

MICROSOFT IS XDR-FIRST:
Detections and correlation happen upstream, and Sentinel focuses on

In Microsoft Sentinel + XDR:
1. XDR detects first — endpoint, identity, email, cloud apps handled by 
   Microsoft-managed, ML + behavior-based detections
2. Sentinel ingests outcomes — XDR incidents, select identity logs, 
   network/cloud logs, business context
3. Sentinel rules change purpose — XDR + network correlation, XDR + 
   cloud/IAM, XDR + threat intel, XDR + asset criticality

Mental model: XDR is the first brain for Defender signals. Sentinel is 
the second brain for enterprise context.

SIDE-BY-SIDE:
• Primary detection: Splunk = SIEM | Microsoft = XDR
• Correlation: Splunk = Customer-built | Microsoft = XDR + Sentinel
• Endpoint intelligence: Splunk = External | Microsoft = Native
• Detection ownership: Splunk = You | Microsoft = Shared with Microsoft
• Ingestion strategy: Splunk = 'Bring everything' | Microsoft = 'Bring what adds value'
• Rule maintenance: Splunk = High | Microsoft = Reduced
• Architecture style: Splunk = Centralized | Microsoft = Layered

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR MIGRATION:
A Splunk → Sentinel migration is NOT lift-and-shift rules or 1:1 rewrite.
It IS detection re-architecture — retiring duplicate logic, letting XDR 
do what it's designed for, using Sentinel where correlation truly adds value.

            <pre><code>"This is a critical architectural decision. The recommended approach is 
XDR-first: enable XDR from Day 1 and build Sentinel detections only for 
what Sentinel needs to own.

WHY XDR-FIRST:
The anti-pattern is building 500+ Sentinel rules, then enabling XDR later 
and discovering half are redundant. You waste engineering effort, extend 
the timeline, and force SOC retraining.

The right approach:
1. Enable M365 Defender XDR connector in Month 1
2. Map legacy detections: XDR handles | Sentinel needed | Custom
3. Build ~270 Sentinel rules (not 500+) for Sentinel's domain
4. Get XDR correlation benefits from Day 1

DETECTION OWNERSHIP MODEL:
XDR handles (automatic, don't rebuild):
• Endpoint: LSASS access, encoded PowerShell, ransomware behavior
• Identity: Impossible travel, password spray, Kerberoasting
• Email: Phishing, BEC, malicious attachments
• Cloud Apps: OAuth abuse, mass download, unusual access

Sentinel handles (~270 rules):
• Network: Firewall denies, C2 beaconing, DNS tunneling
• Azure: Resource deletion, NSG changes, Key Vault access
• DLP: Purview policy violations, exfiltration correlation
• Higher-order: XDR incidents + network/business context

KEY INSIGHT:
In Splunk, correlation is centralized — all telemetry goes to the SIEM.
In Microsoft, correlation is layered — XDR handles endpoint + identity + 
email upstream, Sentinel handles network + Azure + higher-order.

This is why Sentinel migrations are architectural, not mechanical. You're 
redesigning detection ownership, not translating 1:1.

RESULT:
• 270 Sentinel rules (not 580)
• 12-month timeline (not 18)
• XDR correlation from Day 1
• Right-sized effort, no wasted work"</code></pre>

            <pre><code>"No — when XDR is enabled, we don't automatically ingest all raw MDE tables 
into Sentinel. XDR already handles endpoint correlation and produces 
high-fidelity incidents, which Sentinel consumes.

THE ANTI-PATTERN:
Ingesting all Device* tables (DeviceProcessEvents, DeviceNetworkEvents, 
DeviceFileEvents, etc.) into Sentinel when XDR is enabled.

WHY IT'S WRONG:
• Duplicates detection — XDR already correlates these events
• Increases storage cost — even 'free' tables have retention costs
• Creates noise — SOC sees same events in multiple places
• Confuses workflows — which source of truth?

WHAT WE ACTUALLY INGEST:
• SecurityIncident, SecurityAlert (XDR incidents) — ALWAYS
• DeviceNetworkEvents — SELECTIVELY, only if we need it for 
  XDR + firewall correlation (higher-order rules)
• Other Device* tables — NOT ingested

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
Ask: Does XDR already detect and explain this attack?
Ask: Do we need raw fields for cross-vendor correlation?
Ask: Is this worth the ingestion cost and SOC complexity?

If XDR handles it and you don't need raw fields for cross-domain 
correlation → don't ingest.

VALID USE CASES FOR SELECTIVE INGESTION:
• Cross-domain correlation: XDR incident + firewall bytes (needs 
  DeviceNetworkEvents for IP mapping)
• Advanced hunting: Specific threat model requiring raw process data
• Regulatory requirement: Compliance mandates specific log retention
• Temporary validation: During migration, comparing XDR vs legacy

RESULT:
Before (naive): All Device* tables — ~150 GB/day
After (XDR-first): XDR incidents + 1 selective table — ~25 GB/day
80% reduction in endpoint data volume."</code></pre>

            <pre><code>"Three things determine SIEM success:

1. SOC ADOPTION
   The SIEM is only successful if the SOC uses it effectively. 
   Metrics don't matter if analysts are frustrated, overwhelmed, 
   or working around the tool.
   
   Success indicator: Analysts prefer the new SIEM over the old one.
   Failure indicator: "We still use the old tool for real investigations."

2. DETECTION COVERAGE THAT MATTERS
   Not "we have 500 rules" — but "we detect the threats relevant to 
   our business."
   
   Success indicator: Detections map to actual risks, generate 
   actionable alerts, and have reasonable true positive rates.
   Failure indicator: High alert volume, low incident rate, analyst 
   fatigue.

3. OPERATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY
   Can the team maintain this without burning out?
   
   Success indicator: Stable alert volume, clear processes, continuous 
   improvement cadence.
   Failure indicator: Detection debt growing, no one tuning rules, 
   same false positives for months.

THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE:
A successful SIEM deployment is one where:
• Security outcomes improve (faster detection, better coverage)
• Operations are sustainable (not overwhelming the SOC)
• The business is protected (risks are mitigated)

Technical metrics are means to these ends, not ends themselves.

My personal test: Six months after deployment, does the SOC feel 
more capable or less capable? If less, we failed regardless of how 
many log sources we connected."</code></pre>

            <pre><code>"XDR detection is fundamentally different from SIEM detection. This is 
a critical concept that's often misunderstood.

SIEM DETECTION MODEL:
• You author detection rules (KQL, SPL, etc.)
• You configure correlation logic
• You maintain and tune the rules
• Detection quality depends on your rule engineering

XDR DETECTION MODEL:
• Detections are Microsoft-managed — you cannot see the exact logic
• Detections are behavior + ML-based, continuously updated
• Correlation is AUTOMATIC — no correlation rules to configure
• You cannot edit built-in detections, and you shouldn't recreate them
• This is the core value of XDR

TWO TYPES OF XDR DETECTIONS:

1. Built-in XDR Detections (Primary)
   • Microsoft-managed
   • Cover: malware, ransomware, credential theft, lateral movement, 
     phishing chains, BEC
   • You: trust them, consume the incidents, don't rebuild them

2. Custom Detections in XDR (Secondary, Optional)
   • Created via Advanced Hunting queries
   • Scoped to Defender data only
   • For niche scenarios Microsoft doesn't cover
   • NOT a detection engine replacement
   • Think of these as tactical add-ons

WHAT THIS MEANS PRACTICALLY:
When XDR is enabled, you're trusting Microsoft's detection engine for 
endpoint, identity, email, and cloud apps. Sentinel's role becomes 
higher-order:
• Correlate XDR incidents with network context (firewall, DNS)
• Correlate XDR incidents with Azure control plane
• Correlate XDR incidents with DLP events
• Correlate XDR incidents with business context

KEY INSIGHT:
The sentence 'XDR detection rules' is almost a misnomer. XDR has 
detections, but they're not rules you author. If someone asks 'how 
many detection rules do you have in XDR?' — that's treating XDR like 
a SIEM, which misses the point.

The right framing: 'XDR handles endpoint/identity/email detection with 
Microsoft-managed, continuously updated detections. Sentinel handles 
~270 rules for network, Azure, DLP, and higher-order correlation.'"</code></pre>

XDR CORRELATES AUTOMATICALLY WITHIN DEFENDER SIGNALS:
• Endpoint (MDE)
• Email (Defender for Office 365)
• Identity (Defender for Identity)
• Cloud Apps (Defender for Cloud Apps)

This correlation is built-in, ML/behavior-driven, and produces unified 
incidents. No custom correlation rules needed.

KEY RULE: If all signals are Defender-native → XDR handles it.
If any signal is non-Defender → Sentinel rule required.

SENTINEL RULES REQUIRED FOR:

1. XDR + Network telemetry
   Example: XDR malware incident + outbound traffic to C2 IP
   Why: Firewall/proxy/DNS logs are not in XDR

2. XDR + Cloud infrastructure (outside Defender)
   Example: XDR endpoint compromise + AWS IAM key creation
   Why: AWS CloudTrail is not a Defender signal

3. XDR + Custom applications
   Example: XDR incident on dev workstation + suspicious repo access
   Why: Internal app logs are not in XDR

4. XDR + Business context
   Example: XDR incident involving VIP user or crown-jewel system
   Why: CMDB/asset criticality is not in XDR

5. XDR + External threat intel
   Example: XDR incident + IP in premium TI feed (not Microsoft's)
   Why: External TI feeds live in Sentinel, not XDR

6. XDR + External vulnerability data
   Example: XDR malware + Qualys critical CVE + exposed firewall
   Why: Third-party vuln scanners are not in XDR

THE ARCHITECTURE:
• XDR: Detect & correlate Defender signals (automatic)
• Sentinel: Correlate XDR with external telemetry (user-authored rules)
• SOAR: Orchestrate response

ENTRA ID LOGS: YES, YOU STILL NEED THEM

Defender for Identity (MDI) + XDR covers identity ATTACKS:
• Credential theft, lateral movement, privilege escalation
• Suspicious authentication behavior
• Reconnaissance against identity infrastructure
• This is behavioral, attack-focused — produces XDR incidents

Entra ID diagnostic logs cover identity OPERATIONS:
• SigninLogs — who signed in, how, where
• AuditLogs — changes to users, roles, apps, Conditional Access
• ProvisioningLogs — user/app provisioning
• These are control-plane logs for governance, compliance, audit

KEY INSIGHT: They are complementary, not duplicates.

Why you still need Entra ID logs:
1. Governance questions: Who granted admin rights? Who modified CA?
2. Change tracking: Role assignments, MFA policy changes (not attacks)
3. Cross-domain correlation: XDR incident + recent admin role assignment
4. Investigation context: Validate XDR incident with sign-in details
5. Regulatory evidence: Audit trails for compliance

WHAT TO INGEST:
✅ Keep: SigninLogs, AuditLogs, Identity Protection outputs, XDR incidents
❌ Avoid: Rebuilding MDI detections in Sentinel

---

RAW MDE TABLES: USUALLY NO

When XDR is enabled, endpoint detections (malware, ransomware, LOLBins) 
are already handled. Streaming all Device* tables into Sentinel:
• Duplicates detections
• Increases cost
• Adds noise
• Confuses SOC workflows

DEFAULT POSTURE:
• Ingest SecurityIncident + SecurityAlert from XDR
• Do NOT ingest full Device* telemetry

SELECTIVE INGESTION only when:
1. Cross-domain correlation XDR can't do (XDR + firewall/DNS)
2. Bespoke detections not covered by XDR
3. Migration/validation phase (temporary)

DECISION CHECKLIST:
1. Does XDR already detect this? (If yes → don't ingest)
2. Need raw fields for non-Defender correlation? (If yes → selective)

COMPONENTS OF A SIT:
1. Primary Pattern — regex or function that identifies the data
   Example: \d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4} for SSN format

2. Keywords — contextual words that increase confidence
   Example: 'social security', 'SSN', 'tax ID'

3. Checksum/Function — validation algorithm (Luhn for credit cards)
   Example: Luhn check ensures credit card numbers are valid

4. Proximity — how close keywords must be to pattern (usually 300 chars)

5. Confidence Level — likelihood match is true positive (65/75/85%)
   Low = pattern only
   Medium = pattern + keywords
   High = pattern + keywords + checksum

SIT CATEGORIES:
• Financial (50+): Credit Card, Bank Account, SWIFT, IBAN
• Health (30+): SSN, Health Insurance Claim
• National ID (100+): SSN, Canadian SIN, UK NIN, German ID
• Credentials (20+): Azure AD Client Secret, AWS Access Key
• Custom: Organization-specific patterns

BUILT-IN VS CUSTOM:
Purview has 300+ built-in SITs vs Symantec's smaller library.

than patterns. It's for when pattern-based SITs would cause too many

HOW EDM WORKS:
1. You export sensitive data (employee IDs, customer numbers) to CSV
2. EDM Upload Agent hashes the data on-premises
3. Only HASHES are uploaded to cloud (actual data stays on-prem)
4. DLP compares content hashes against your data hashes
5. Match = alert/block

WHEN TO USE EDM VS PATTERN-BASED SITs:

USE PATTERN-BASED:
• Credit cards — Luhn checksum validates any valid CC
• Generic PII (SSN) — well-defined patterns
• Standard formats — predictable structure

USE EDM:
• Employee IDs — pattern might match random numbers
• Customer account numbers — high false positive risk
• Patient record numbers — format varies
• Any organization-specific identifiers

EDM SCALABILITY:
• Up to 100 million rows per data store
• Up to 32 columns per schema
• Up to 5 searchable columns
• Daily refresh capability

            <pre><code>"My Splunk experience comes from my SOC analyst role at Cognizant, where 
I used it daily for alert triage, incident investigations, and log analysis. 
I'm comfortable with SPL for querying and building dashboards, and I 
understand how Splunk fits into security operations from the analyst 
perspective.

That said, I haven't done enterprise Splunk deployments or administration — 
my hands-on SIEM platform engineering experience is primarily with Microsoft 
Sentinel.

However, I'm confident the core concepts transfer directly:
• Log ingestion and parsing — same problem, different syntax
• Detection engineering — correlation rules, alert tuning, use case development
• Data onboarding — connectors, forwarders, data quality validation
• Cost management — volume-based pricing, retention strategies

I've also invested time in understanding Splunk architecture conceptually — 
indexers, search heads, forwarders, deployment server — and I'm confident 
I can ramp up quickly on the platform-specific details. The fundamentals 
of SIEM engineering are the same; it's the implementation that differs."</code></pre>

            <pre><code>"At a high level, Splunk uses a distributed architecture with these 
key components:

FORWARDERS (Data Collection)
• Universal Forwarder — lightweight agent on endpoints/servers
• Heavy Forwarder — can parse and filter before forwarding
• Similar to: Azure Monitor Agent, Sentinel connectors

INDEXERS (Data Storage & Processing)
• Receive data from forwarders
• Parse, index, and store events
• Handle search requests for their data
• Similar to: Log Analytics workspace backend

SEARCH HEADS (Query & Visualization)
• User interface for searches, dashboards, alerts
• Distribute searches across indexers
• Similar to: Sentinel portal, Log Analytics query interface

DEPLOYMENT SERVER (Management)
• Centrally manage forwarder configurations
• Push apps and configurations to forwarders
• Similar to: Intune for agent policies, DCR management

CLUSTER ARCHITECTURE (Enterprise Scale)
• Indexer clustering for high availability and replication
• Search head clustering for load balancing
• Similar to: Azure's built-in HA for Sentinel

The data flow is:
Source → Forwarder → Indexer → Search Head → User

For cloud deployments, Splunk Cloud abstracts much of this — similar to 
how Sentinel is fully managed. But understanding the architecture helps 
when troubleshooting data flow issues or planning capacity."</code></pre>

            <pre><code>"My approach would follow the same SIEM deployment methodology I used 
with Sentinel:

1. DISCOVERY
   • Inventory existing log sources and security tools
   • Understand detection requirements and compliance needs
   • Assess current SOC maturity and workflows
   • Identify quick wins and critical gaps

2. ARCHITECTURE DESIGN
   • Size the deployment based on expected ingest volume
   • Decide: Splunk Cloud vs on-prem vs hybrid
   • Plan forwarder deployment strategy
   • Design index strategy for retention and performance

3. DATA ONBOARDING (Prioritized)
   • Priority 1: Identity, endpoint, cloud (detection anchors)
   • Priority 2: Network and perimeter
   • Priority 3: Application-specific sources
   • Validate data quality at each stage

4. DETECTION IMPLEMENTATION
   • Enable Splunk ES content where applicable
   • Translate existing rules or build new based on requirements
   • Tune thresholds for the environment
   • Validate with SOC before production

5. SOC ENABLEMENT
   • Build operational dashboards
   • Create investigation playbooks
   • Train analysts on SPL and workflows
   • Establish feedback loop for continuous improvement

The platform is different, but the methodology is the same. I'd lean on 
Splunk documentation and potentially team members for platform-specific 
implementation details while applying my SIEM engineering experience to 
drive the overall approach."</code></pre>
